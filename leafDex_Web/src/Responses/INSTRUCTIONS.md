# COMPSCI 426 SCALABLE WEB SYSTEMS
## SPRING 2025
## FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION

# OVERVIEW

The final project submission is designed for you to convey what you
have learned as part of working on an independent project in a team
with minimal effort. This does not mean that you are to submit
minimal work - rather - we are looking for conciseness and clarity.
Anything that is unclear or lacks conciseness will simply be marked
as a 0. Please read the instructions and understand them completely.

# TASKS

You are provided with a template `SUBMISSION.md` file. This file
includes areas you must fill in. They are labelled with a `TODO`.
Only replace the `TODO` and any text that follows that `TODO`. You
are to leave the rest of the file structure in place to allow for
automatic checks for compliance.

For example:

```markdown
**System Name:**
- <TODO: Provide the name of the system you worked on.>>
```

Should be filled in like this:

```markdown
- Automatic Watercolor Frenzy
```

The `<` and `>` and everything in between are to be replaced by your
own text. Any list item markers, such as `-`, and spaces are to be
retained exactly or you will be harshly penalized. Deviating from
these requirements will not be accepted.

All code blocks must be replaced entirely with your own code.

Please see the `SUBMISSION.md` file for what you are to provide. To
see an example submission, look at `REFERENCE-SUBMISSION.md`. 
Although this is an example, you are to make this submission
your own.

# SUBMISSION

You are to submit the `SUBMISSION.md` file to Gradescope by the due
date. There may or may not be an auto-graded system that will provide
initial feedback. The primary grade will come from a manual review of
your submission.
